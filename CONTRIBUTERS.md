Like most things, BtoA wasn't created in a vacuum. Luna Digital picked up the project when another group ultimately dropped it after years of development behind closed doors. A lot of what code *was* available publicly helped inform and shape how we develop BtoA. Thank you to everyone who put time and effort into this project!

Special thanks to the LuxCore team. We based our implementation of Arnold's node system on their own node implementation in the LuxCore Blender add-on.
