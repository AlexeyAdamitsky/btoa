# Arnold for Blender #

BtoA is an unofficial Blender add-on for Autodesk's Arnold render engine.

### Current functionality ###

There is very little Arnold-specific functionality at the moment. The engine can render a hard-coded scene of a red sphere and light to your home directory, but it does not display in Blender at all. We're in the early days of development, and will be updating code publicly as we make progress. We guarantee that the code you see here will always be up-to-date with what we're working on internally.

The add-on is installable, and automatically detects the Arnold installation from the $ARNOLD_ROOT environment variable. If this variable is not set, you can manually set the installation location in the add-on preferences.

### Getting involved ###
This add-on is developed and maintained by Aaron Powell at Luna Digital, Ltd. (aaron@lunadigital.tv). Feel free to reach out if you're interested in testing or contributing!
